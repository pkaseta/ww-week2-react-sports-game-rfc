# ww-week2-react-sports-game-rfc

In this weeks demo we will be rebuilding the React Basics sports game from earlier in Q2. This time around we will be building a hockey game using React functional components. The main ideas are outlined below...

Create a Teams component to hold all of the information for the teams. The information needed will be Shots (with a button to shoot), Points (which will be decided on a random chance when you shoot) and Save Percentage which will be defined by an equation. Also the save percentage should not show unless a shot is taken. 

Followed by a game component. The game component will house an array of all the teams you create (we are making 4) so we can create a randomizer for which two teams will face off against one another at the start of each game. 

Also do not forget to npm install so you can use all of your React node modules. 

Most of the CSS has already been done to save time, also the images and sounds we will be using are included!

Have fun and enjoy!!
